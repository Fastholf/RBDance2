This program is designed for robot shows. It can play predefined moves on several robots connected via bluetooth with music. Robots are [Robobuilders](http://www.robobuilder.net/en/). 
Actually you can play the same moves directly from robots. The problem is that their moves won't be synchronous. Which is bad, because these moves are supposed to be dance.
So this program solves this problem.
